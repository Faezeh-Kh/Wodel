  "body": "**Wodel** is a Domain-Specific Language for the specification and generation of model mutants. A\r\n\r\nWodel is domain-independent, as it can be used to generate mutants of models conforming to arbitrary meta-models.\r\n\r\nIt's development environment is extensible, permitting the incorporation of post-processors for different applications.\r\n\r\nAs an example, this repository contains an application consisting on the automated generation of exercises for particular domains\r\n(automata, class diagrams, electronic circuits, etc.). We call this extension **Wodel-Edu**.\r\n\r\nThis is a sample of a Wodel program that mutates a transition target of a Deterministic Finite Automaton model:\r\n\r\n    generate 2 mutants\r\n    in \"out/\"\r\n    from \"model/\"\r\n    metamodel \"http://dfaAutomaton/1.0\"\r\n    \r\n    with commands {\r\n         modify target tar from one Transition to other State\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can specify when mutants are going to be generated inside a Wodel program with the _blocks_ directive.\r\n\r\nAlso, you can mutate mutant models generated in a previous block, instead of mutating the seed models.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, you can specify OCL constraints that will apply to the generated mutants:\r\n\r\n    generate mutants\r\n    in \"out/\"\r\n    from \"model/exercise1.model\"\r\n    metamodel \"http://dfaAutomaton/1.0\"\r\n    \r\n    with blocks {\r\n        first {\r\n             modify target tar from one Transition to other State [3]             \r\n\t} [2]\r\n        second from first repeat=no {\r\n             modify one State with { name = random-string(4,6)}\r\n        } [3]\r\n    }\r\n    constraints {\r\n        context State connected: \"isInitial or Set{self}->\r\n                closure(s | Transition.allInstances()->\r\n                select(t | t.tar=s)->collect(src))->exists(s | s.isInitial)\"\r\n    }\r\n\r\n",
