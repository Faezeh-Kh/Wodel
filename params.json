  "body": "Wodel is a domain-specific language for the specification and generation of model mutants.\r\n\r\nWodel is domain-independent, as it can be used to generate mutants of models conforming to arbitrary metamodels.\r\n\r\nIt's development environment is extensible, permitting the incorporation of post-processors for different applications.\r\n\r\nAs an example, this repository contains an application consisting on the automated generation of exercises for particular domains\r\n(automata, class diagrams, electronic circuits, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis is a sample of a Wodel program that mutates a transition target of a Deterministic Finite Automaton model:\r\n\r\n    generate 2 mutants\r\n    in \"out/\"\r\n    from \"model/\" all\r\n    metamodel \"http://dfaAutomaton/1.0\"\r\n    \r\n    with commands {\r\n         modify target tar from one Transition to other State\r\n    }\r\n",
